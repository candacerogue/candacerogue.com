                                        <p className="subtitle">Never underestimate a custom job.</p>
                                        <p>Have you ever tried building a site from scratch? If you're an aspiring developer, it's a must. Otherwise, 10 out of 10 do NOT recommend <span role="img" aria-label="crying emoji">ðŸ˜­</span>.</p>
                                        <p>It was the first time I'd build a site from scratch in some time. I greatly underestimated the work and undervalued my time. Like bruh, what was I trying to prove? I'll get into the painpoints soon for devs that are still reading</p>
                                        <h3>Design.</h3>
                                        <p>We were able to quickly narrow down to one of the three design directions I put together in Illustrator (which I prefer over Photoshop for quick prototying), and from there I created the high resolution mockup. I annotated what animations would be included, what the page would like on mobile and how the user would interact with his site.</p>
                                        <h3>Development.</h3>
                                        <p>Building the site from there was actually non eventful, and as any experienced developer would say, "The last 20$% of the project takes 80% of the time." That is exactly what happened <span role="img" aria-label="upside down emoji">ðŸ™ƒ</span>.</p> 
                                        <p>The last 20% of the project almost broke me, because they felt like routine issues I had resolved before in other projects, but they just seemed to come back like a monster's third head! I spent a lot of time working through my initial implementation of the Slick npm module for Vue, and after trying a few other alternatives I soon realized it had more to do with how I was calling the images into the repository.</p> 
                                        <p>I initially used Google Drive to host the images, but Safari was not trying to hear all that. So my good developer friend, Denzel, created a partition of his server for me so that I could host my images there without any cross-browser funny business. While dealing with this hurdle, Safari CSS breakpoints was the part that had me punching walls in my head. I had to crate browser specific breakpoints in order to keep the content from distorting itself. I've never experienced such great disrepect from a browser like Safari did me! Anywho, I'm glad it's over, and I will NEVER take for granted how much I appreciate frameworks out there that create modular and mobile-friendly templates, so I don't have to put up with such nonsense.
